#Issue1: Update Flyer successfully to server but cannot
get proper response from server

#Detail: The issue happened using the default fetch provided by
React which is "whatwg-fetch". When sending "multipart/form-data",
it returned Blob response(code 200) without json response from server.
_Solution: using "axios" library fix this issue.
->"whatwg-fetch" does not implement this part correctly
